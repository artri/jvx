<p>Contains the interfaces and implementations for the new panel.</p>
<p>The new panel implements the layout logic separated from the panel logic,
which means that there is only one panel and multiple layouts. The layouts
itself do not contain any state nor do they have any state in the sense of
client/server shared state.</p>
<p>All shared information is handed by the panel state and the layouts on the
client side are absolutely positioned.</p>
